# Comments can be used to explain Python code.
#
# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
#
# Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
#
# Creating a Comment
# Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

# Single line comment
# This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!")  # This is a comment.

# print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

# Multi Line Comments
# Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:


# This is a comment
# written in
# more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")


"""
This is a comment

print("Hello, World!")
